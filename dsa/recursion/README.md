# Steps for solving a recursion problem

- Show f(1) works (base case)
- Assume f(n - 1) works (the recursive leap of faith)
- Show f(n) works using f(n - 1)

# 5 SIMPLE STEPS

- What's the simplest possible input?
- Play around with examples and visualize!
- Relate hard cases to simpler cases
- Generalize the pattern
- Write code by combining recursive pattern with the base case
