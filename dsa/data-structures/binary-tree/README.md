# Traversal types

- DFS uses stack
- BFS uses queue

## Uses Queue, Breadth-First

### Level order

Also known as Breadth First Traversal. Visits node level by level from top to bottom.

---

## Uses Stack, Depth-First

### Preorder Traversal

Also known as Depth First Traversal where nodes are visited in a root-first manner.

### Inorder Traversal

<b>Helps us sort the tree in ascending order! `left`-`root`-`right` </b>
To sort in descending order, do `right`-`root`-`left`
Another Depth-First Traversal that visits nodes in left-root-right order.

### Postorder Traversal

This is a Depth-First Traversal where nodes are visited left-right-root.
